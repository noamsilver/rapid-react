RapidAPI - Code Challenge

Single page app test using **React**

# Overview
The Drag&Drop Forever app will let you drag an image around the window as you wish.
The location that the image is left at will be remembered, coupled with the user credentials you used to login.

It's a `react` app built with `webpack` that uses `react-router` for client side routing.
It simulates API calls that would of been implemented server-side if it was a full fledged app.

# Usage
```
npm install
npm start
```
The `start` script will build the project, start the `webpack-dev-server` on port 8080 and will open the app in your default web browser.
